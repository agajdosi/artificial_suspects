# **Artificial Suspects**

**Artificial Suspects** is an experimental art game that explores the biases and prejudices of different AI models.
Rather than analyzing training datasets or statistical outputs, this game allows players to experience AI biases firsthand through gameplay in *Unusual Suspects*.

Play the *Unusual Suspects* board game with AI in your browser!
